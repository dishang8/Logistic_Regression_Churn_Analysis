# Logistic_Regression_Churn_Analysis

Logistic Regression on Churn Dataset
This project was completed as part of my Machine Learning Internship at Codveda Technologies.


✅ Objective
Use logistic regression to predict customer churn and analyze key behavioral signals.


📊 Dataset
Used churn-bigml-80.csv and churn-bigml-20.csv (public telecom churn dataset).


🧠 Key Insights
Customer service calls and international plans significantly increase churn odds
Voice mail plans decrease churn risk


🛠️ Tools Used
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
🚀 Project Outcome
This task demonstrates the practical use of logistic regression in real-world classification scenarios involving class imbalance and feature interpretation.
